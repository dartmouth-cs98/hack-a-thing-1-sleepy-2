**Description:** Build an Android alarm clock app that will play a song when the time is reached. After the user shuts off the alarm (hits the turn off alarm button), a cute picture will be shown as a reward for waking up.

**Who did what:** Vivian was in charge of following the Youtube tutorial videos at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbBlzOblD10&list=PL4uut9QecF3DLAacEoTctzeqTyvgzqYwA to build the alarm clock app. Savannah was responsible for adding the image function when the user turns off the alarm.

**What we learned:** We learned how to build an Android app as well as the familiarized ourselves with the process of app building in general which was something neither of us had experience in.

**What didn't work:** The alarm doesn't go off the moment the time is reached (i.e. if the alarm is set to 1:15pm, the alarm doesn't go off when the clock turns 1:15 immediately and takes a couple seconds). We originally wanted to have our alarm clock set up so that the cute picture was shown only if the user turned off the alarm within a certain timeframe, but that proved tricky to implement.
